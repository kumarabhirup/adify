      question: 'Will Adify be absolutely free for pre-launch subscribers?',
      answer: (
        <>
          Yes! If you subscribed before launch day, and sign in with appropriate
          Email Id after the Adify launch, you'll have to bear NO transaction
          charges for all your deals on Adify Platform. Early subscribers will
          get access to unlimited Adspaces, and every thing will be free for
          them.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'Is this just another useless Ad Network?',
      answer: (
        <>
          No! This is NOT an Ad Network. This is NOT a portal where ads are
          bought and sold. It is essentially a SaaS product made to make deals
          between publishers and advertisers more easy.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I have control over my adspace? Can I ban ads?',
      answer: (
        <>
          Yes, you can choose to be a moderator in settings. You can ban ads
          that you don't like. In that case, the money of the advertiser will be
          refunded.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'What kinds of adspaces can be set up?',
      answer: (
        <>
          Typical box-like banner ads, native promotional ads, dynamic
          promotional ads (like the promotions you see on Reddit and Twitter)
          can be set up in a few minutes with Adify.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What if my adspace isn't bought and is empty?",
      answer: (
        <>
          For empty adspaces, you can setup Adsense Ads with a "Buy this
          Adspace" text below. Most of it will be customizable. You'll love it.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'What if two businesses booked the same adspace?',
      answer: (
        <>
          The sponsor that paid higher will get higher impressions. It will be
          in proportion with bidding that other sponsor has done. You don't need
          to care about your ads. They'll be served with accuracy. At max, 5
          bussiness can have one adspace.
        </>

      question: 'How do I contact you?',
